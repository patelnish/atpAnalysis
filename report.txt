### This file summarizes findings for each example plot found in the repository

1. surface_distribution.jpg

Overall, it appears that hard court tournaments tend to be played at the beginning and end of the year. Clay court season lasts February through June, with a few tournaments in July and August. Grass court season tends to be limited to June and July, but the number of tournaments played increased to 5 from 4 after 2014. The overall number of tournaments being played each month appears to be relatively the same across 2012-2017.

It appears that a majority of Federer's wins come on hard courts throughout the years. He had over 50 match wins on hard courts in 2014.

4. nadal_wins_surface.jpg

Clay appears to be the surface where a majority of Nadal's wins come from. However, he also does really well on hard courts. His worse surface with fewest wins is grass.
